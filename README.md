Are you also facing the same problem of updating third party libraries manually in all your iOS projects?

Yes?

Well, what did you do about it?

Nothing?

Or...

You’re looking for solutions but found none? Or may be the solutions you found online didn’t work out so well.

It usually happens with almost every beginners.

I was facing the same trouble as you, when I was working on a project at Space-O Technologies and luckily, I found the ideal solution (Cocoapods). You see working at such a great [mobile app development company](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/mobile-app-development/
) has its own perks. I had a great support of highly experienced developers here and taught me the best solution for this project. So, I wrote [an article](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/cocoapods-swift-tutorial/) on it to share it with you guys here.
